# Monads in Java
This project was created as a project for the HKA WS 24/25.
It explores an implementation of monads in java. Inspiration was taken from haskell's implementation of monads. 

**[monad-experiment](monad-experiment/README.md)** contains a framework for monads in java and some monad implementations.

**[monad-macro](monad-macro/README.md)** contains a clojure macro to port haskell's do-notation to clojure.

**[monad-parser](monad-parser/README.md)** is an example project implementing a framework for a customizable scripting 
language written with the monad implementations from monad-experiment. 

Additional Information to each project is in the README.md of the project.
